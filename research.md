This is regarding the direction of my project research group the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry.

---

The spatial arrangement in 3D (structure) of biomolecules dictates what kinds of physical interactions are favorable and therefore which biological functions are accessible to DNA/RNA/proteins. 
Finding exactly which geometrical patterns within these molecules are the ones we should pay attention to is a needle in the haystack problem.
In this group, we take the data-driven approach.
That is, we build **scalable structure-aware algorithms** that process the growing datasets of biological structures to identify patterns which influence function.
A clear understanding of the patterns that mediate structure to function relationships will help uncover new biological mechanisms and point towards solutions to pathologies.

Here are some active projects.

## Deep learning on protein structures

We recently developed [ProteinShake](https://proteinshake.ai) which allows deep learning practitioners easy asccess to impactful biological tasks on proteins. (Accepted at NeurIPS 2023)

## Representation learning on RNA 3D networks

RNA structures adopt complex folds by forming base pairs, we have developed unsupervised learning methods which have proven useful in [drug discovery](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/14/7690/5870337) and [network motif mining](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/4/970/6428528) applications. Through [rnaglib](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/5/1458/6462185) we hope to explore more applications.

## Graph pattern mining

Structural patterns adopted by molecules are often dynamic and noisy, making traditional graph pattern mining algorithms less appropriate. [MotiFiesta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.0758) captures approximate network patterns in any graph dataset while at the same time serving as pre-training for classification models.

# Open Positions

If you find this interesting, we are looking for a highly motivated **PhD student** to work at the intersection of structural biology, deep learning and pattern mining on graphs.
